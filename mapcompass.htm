        The compass remains pointing north as the map, say too the land. This 
        suggests it is in the right direction for you next location. Each town 
        you click from to the next will set the compass. When you walk on the 
        bearing you need the red arrow in the white hatching, a common feature 
        on compasses. Then you will also notice the dial which you swivel to 
        do this has a degree at the new (usually) longer centre of the the compass.
        That is indicated. Additionally there is an adjustment setting to use to be 
        able to walk on true north, that is magnetic north as the map sees it.
        This changes because that is how it is, plus (see below the map)
        <h4>Click the dots (towns) to activate the compass and find 
            out the location name.
            One click for the start point, one for the finish.

     <p class="col80"> Magnetic North seems to be forecast closely 
        so can be looked up for the country you are in and the year.
        In the UK it has gone from degrees out to parity recently. Watch out 
        for local deviations too, plus certain areas 
        are known to have poor compass suitability like the Red Cullin on Skye,
        near certain urban stations in Japan too I noticed. I carry and use a 
        compass as assistant to help with often vague maps or junctions both 
        walking and biking where it is important to note the bike itself can 
        cause magnetic interference.</p> </main>
